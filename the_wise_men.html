        <h2>The Sports We Play</h2>
        <p>We may be chill, but we‚Äôre still competitive when it comes to our favorite sports! Here‚Äôs a peek at the games we love:</p>
        <div class="sports-list">
            <!-- Football -->
            <div>
                <h3>Football</h3>
                <p>Whether it's a friendly game at the park or a full-blown match, we‚Äôre all about that fast-paced action, epic goals, and good-natured trash talk. We‚Äôve got players who can show you how to score a banger, and others who just like to kick it and enjoy the game with their mates. After all, it‚Äôs about the fun, not the pressure.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Hockey -->
            <div>
                <h3>Hockey (UK-style)</h3>
                <p>In the UK, hockey is played on grass or astroturf, and it's all about precision, speed, and skill. Whether it‚Äôs a local match or a competitive league, we love getting stuck in, passing with finesse, and scoring those perfect goals. There‚Äôs something about the teamwork and strategy involved that makes it so enjoyable‚Äîplus, the camaraderie and banter off the field are just as great. It‚Äôs fast-paced, tactical, and always a good laugh.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Cricket -->
            <div>
                <h3>Cricket</h3>
                <p>From the quiet elegance of the field to the thrilling sound of the bat hitting the ball, cricket is where we take things down a notch while still keeping the intensity alive. There‚Äôs something about the long games, the strategy, and the camaraderie that makes cricket the perfect sport for a chill hangout.</p>
